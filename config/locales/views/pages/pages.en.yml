      title_1: A place for knowledge transmission
      paragraph_1: >
        What could be more precious than our knowledge?
        It is the result or our experiences, our learning or sometimes our failures.
        It is shaped by time and evolves constantly.
        But above all, we owe our knowledge to those who have transmitted it to us.
        It is up to us to do the same.
        Papoters is a place created to facilitate this transmission, bringing together the holders of knowledge and those who seek wise answers.
      title_2: Granting advising its fair value
      paragraph_2_1: >
        Holding knowledge means being able to articulate pieces of information to give them a sense or a utility.
        It is clear that we now have access to a huge amount of information.
        Yet, the flow that reaches us is messy and pointless without the keys to process it.
        It takes work, time and real expertise to retreive consistent knowledge from pieces of information.
        One of the roles of the knowledge holder is to propose filters and methods to effectively transmit what he knows.
        It is also to provide tailor-made answers to those who request it.
        This is the role of an advisor.
      paragraph_2_2: >
        Papoters wants to grant the advisory service its fair value.
        This value lies in the quality, the consistency or the originality of the information transmitted.
        It also depends on the advisor's teaching skills or his ability to communicate.
        Gradually, the value of the service is established by those who experience it.
        Papoters offers a collaborative environment that allows these mechanisms to run freely, so that the community ensures the value of what advisors offer.
      title_3: Unleashing the communication
      paragraph_3: >
        Communication is a key aspect of advisory services.
        It can sometimes be a barrier that limits the potential for sharing broadly.
        Papoters provides its users with the means to communicate by controlling the constraints of space and time.
        Each advisory session is unique and participants must be allowed to agree on its conditions.
        They may choose the working language or the means of communication available.
        Unleashing communication broaden perspectives for those who want to be advised or to share their knowledge!
